## Approach:
Here's how I approached the missing data issue: üí™

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Exploration: 
I began by examining the dataset to identify any missing values or incomplete records. Using Python's powerful libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, I gained insights into the structure and content of the data.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Missing Data Detection: 
To identify missing data, I utilized Python's DataFrame functions to check for null values, NaNs, or placeholders. These indicators helped me pinpoint the areas where data was absent.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Imputation: 
To fill in the gaps, I employed various techniques. For numerical data, I used methods like mean, median, or regression to estimate missing values based on the available information. Categorical data, on the other hand, underwent imputation through techniques like mode or interpolation.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Validation:
After imputing the missing values, it was crucial to validate the integrity and reliability of the data. I cross-referenced the imputed values with the original dataset, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Tableau Dashboard Creation: 
With the missing data handled, I dove into the exciting realm of Tableau. Leveraging its user-friendly interface and powerful visualization capabilities, I crafted an engaging and visually appealing Marvel vs. D.C. Stats dashboard. It encapsulates the essence of the superhero rivalry, presenting an array of captivating charts, graphs, and visualizations.
